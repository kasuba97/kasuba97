# Geoffrey Kasuba Sichali - Web3 Enthusiast && Quantum Enthusiast

Greetings! 👋🏾

I go by the name Kasuba97 and I hail from Zambia. My passion lies in the dynamic realm of web3 technologies, where I find myself deeply engrossed in the world of decentralized systems, cryptocurrencies, and cutting-edge advancements. As an ardent learner, I continually immerse myself in the intricacies of various programming languages, frameworks such as React, and even explore the quantum realms through tools like Qiskit. 

My journey into the world of development has been a captivating one, particularly given my background without any formal computer science education. During my high school years, my fascination with gaming fueled a curious inquiry into the mechanics behind it all. Over the past few years, I've embarked on a relentless pursuit of knowledge, embracing every available avenue including online courses and enriching books, all of which now constitute a cherished chapter in my story. 😊
