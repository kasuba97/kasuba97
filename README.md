### Hi there👋🏾,
#
I'm Kasuba97 from Zambia. I really enjoy learning new language, frameworks like react and qiskit, homebrew,etc. Learning development is one of my many hobbies, and I feel accomplished when I learned new software development skills.

From start i knew learning development was going to be quite an exciting journey considering that i don't have any computer science mojors prior. During a high school,I really enjoyed gaming that I developed a curious mind on how its all brought about. its in the recent years that i decided to pick almost every free learning course👩🏾‍💻 and books📚 i could find and learn,all that is history now.😊
